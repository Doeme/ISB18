\subsection*{Describe financial benefits which the product can create in the market}

Simulation results of fermentation processes lead to be deeper knowledge about starting conditions of the fermentation, the fermentation
process and the produced beer. This leads to enhanced production processes, lower production costs with increased product quality.
Also secondary processes involved in the production line can be refined, e.g. the cleaning of the production tanks, which leads to lower
production costs. Enhanced production processes can also be used to enlarge the durability of the produced beer which is especially
important for smaller sized breweries and special kinds of beer which can not be drained.

New developments in the field of microbial communities can lead to reduced process costs, e.g. the usage of bacteria to reduce the uranium
concentration in contaminated areas \cite{zhuang2011genome}.
