\noindent
\textbf{Describe the novelty of the project and how the results from it can be applied to the benefit of society}

Novelty:
\begin{itemize}
 \item GEMs have not been used in the field of beer brewing
 \item other implementations of algorithms are mostly in matlab and use costly modules
 \item our approach will be open-source and available for free
\end{itemize}

Application of results:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The simulation framework:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item is completely free available and open source
  \item can also be used by students to learn more about this topic
  \item can be used by smaller companies (cheaper than matlab)
  \item can be interesting by academic research (cheaper than matlab)
  \item will enable new development in the field of co-culture simulation
  \item will help to create new solutions how to generate metabolites in a co-culture of several bacterias
 \end{itemize}

 \item The simulation results:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item The simulation environment and the setup will be available for free
  \item can be used by smaller breweries to
  \begin{itemize}
   \item the quality of their beer
   \item reducing costs of production: less cleaning effort, more efficient processes,...
  \end{itemize}
  \item reduces the impact on the environment: less usage of chemicals for cleaning
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\noindent
\textbf{Describe how the project can lead to the development of goods, processes or services}
\begin{itemize}
 \item new production methods due to co-cultures: find here something in the papers
\end{itemize}



\noindent
\textbf{Which technological and design challenges are posed by the project}

\begin{itemize}
 \item the most implementations are in matlab, ours will be in python
 \item python does not provide many libraries as they are available in matlab
 \item it will be neccessary to find alternative ways for implementation / adapt existing algorithms to available ressorces in python
\end{itemize}
