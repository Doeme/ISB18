In this review, the authors provide an overview of the emerging DFBA approach with a focus on two case studies involving the conversion of mixed hexose/pentose sugar mixtures by synthetic microbial coculture systems. These case studies illustrate the key requirements of the DFBA approach, including the incorporation of individual species metabolic reconstructions, formulation of extracellular mass balances, identiﬁcation of substrate uptake kinetics, numerical solution of the coupled linear program/differential equations and model adaptation for common, suboptimal growth conditions and identiﬁed species interactions.

Fermentative microorganisms can reduce compounds such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), but detoxiﬁcation is accompanied by reduced growth rates and ethanol yields. In this study, we assess the effects of these furan aldehydes on pure and mixed yeast cultures consisting of a respiratory deﬁcient mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and wild-type Scheffersomyces stipitis using dynamic ﬂux balance analysis. Uptake kinetics and stoichiometric equations for the intracellular reduction reactions associated with each inhibitor were added to genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of the two yeasts. Further modiﬁcation of the S. cerevisiae metabolic network was necessary to satisfactorily predict the amount of acetate synthesized during HMF reduction. Inhibitory terms that captured the adverse effects of the furan aldehydes and their corresponding alcohols on cell growth and ethanol production were added to attain qualitative agreement with batch experiments conducted for model development and validation. When the two yeasts were co-cultured in the presence of the furan aldehydes, inoculums that reduced the synthesis of highly toxic acetate produced by S. cerevisiae yielded the highest ethanol productivities. The model described here can be used to generate optimal fermentation strategies for the simultaneous detoxiﬁcation and fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates by S. cerevisiae and/or S. stipitis.},

	abstract = {Sequential uptake of pentose and hexose sugars that compose lignocellulosic biomass limits the ability of pure microbial cultures to efﬁciently produce value-added bioproducts. In this work, we used dynamic ﬂux balance modeling to examine the capability of mixed cultures of substrate-selective microbes to improve the utilization of glucose/xylose mixtures and to convert these mixed substrates into products. Co-culture simulations of Escherichia coli strains ALS1008 and ZSC113, engineered for glucose and xylose only uptake respectively, indicated that improvements in batch substrate consumption observed in previous experimental studies resulted primarily from an increase in ZSC113 xylose uptake relative to wild-type E. coli. The E. coli strain ZSC113 engineered for the elimination of glucose uptake was computationally co-cultured with wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can only metabolize glucose, to determine if the co-culture was capable of enhanced ethanol production compared to pure cultures of wild-type E. coli and the S. cerevisiae strain RWB218 engineered for combined glucose and xylose uptake. Under the simplifying assumption that both microbes grow optimally under common environmental conditions, optimization of the strain inoculum and the aerobic to anaerobic switching time produced an almost twofold increase in ethanol productivity over the pure cultures. To examine the effect of reduced strain growth rates at non-optimal pH and temperature values, a break even analysis was performed to determine possible reductions in individual strain substrate uptake rates that resulted in the same predicted ethanol productivity as the best pure culture.},

	abstract = {Steady-state and dynamic ﬂux balance analysis (DFBA) was used to investigate the effects of metabolic model complexity and parameters on ethanol production predictions for wild-type and engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three metabolic network models ranging from a single compartment representation of metabolism to a genome-scale reconstruction with seven compartments and detailed charge balancing were studied. Steady-state analysis showed that the models generated similar wild-type predictions for the biomass and ethanol yields, but for ten engineered strains the seven compartment model produced smaller ethanol yield enhancements. Simpliﬁcation of the seven compartment model to two intracellular compartments produced increased ethanol yields, suggesting that reaction localisation had an impact on mutant phenotype predictions. Further analysis with the seven compartment model demonstrated that steady-state predictions can be sensitive to intracellular model parameters, with the biomass yield exhibiting high sensitivity to ATP utilisation parameters and the biomass composition. The incorporation of gene expression data through the zeroing of metabolic reactions associated with unexpressed genes was shown to produce negligible changes in steady-state predictions when the oxygen uptake rate was suitably constrained. Dynamic extensions of the single and seven compartment models were developed through the addition of glucose and oxygen uptake expressions and transient extracellular balances. While the dynamic models produced similar predictions of the optimal batch ethanol productivity for the wild type, the single compartment model produced signiﬁcantly different predictions for four implementable gene insertions. A combined deletion/overexpression/insertion mutant with improved ethanol productivity capabilities was computationally identiﬁed by dynamically screening multiple combinations of the ten metabolic engineering strategies. The authors concluded that extensive compartmentalisation and detailed charge balancing can be important for reliably screening metabolic engineering strategies that rely on modiﬁcation of the global redox balance and that DFBA offers the potential to identify novel mutants for enhanced metabolite production in batch and fed-batch cultures.},

	abstract = {Metabolic engineering involves application of recombinant DNA methods to manipulate metabolic networks to improve cellular properties. It is critical that the genetic alterations be performed in an optimal manner to maximize profit. In addition to the product yield, productivity consideration is also critical, especially for the production of bulk chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol. In this work, we demonstrate that it is suboptimal from the standpoint of productivity to induce genetic alteration at the start of the production process. A bilevel optimization scheme is formulated to determine the optimal temporal flux profile for the manipulated reaction. In the first case study, an optimal flux in the reaction catalyzed by glycerol kinase is determined to maximize the glycerol production at the end of a 6-h batch cultivation of Escherichia coli under aerobic conditions. The final glycerol concentration is 30\% higher for the optimal flux profile compared with having an active flux during the entire batch. The effect of the mass transfer coefficient on the optimal profile and the glycerol concentration is also determined. In the second case study, the anaerobic batch fermentation of the ldhÀ strain of Escherichia coli is considered. The optimal flux in the acetate pathway is determined to maximize the final ethanol concentration. The optimal flux results in higher ethanol concentration (11.92 mmol LÀ1) compared to strains with no acetate flux (8.36 mmol LÀ1) and fully active acetate flux (6.22 mmol LÀ1). We also examine the effects of growth inhibition due to high ethanol concentrations and variations in final batch time on ethanol production. B 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Typically, FBA is used to study the metabolic flux at a particular steady state of the system. However, there are many situations where the reprogramming of the metabolic network is important. Therefore, the dynamics of these metabolic networks have to be studied. In this paper, we have extended FBA to account for dynamics and present two different formulations for dynamic FBA. These two approaches were used in the analysis of diauxic growth in Escherichia coli. Dynamic FBA was used to simulate the batch growth of E. coli on glucose, and the predictions were found to qualitatively match experimental data. The dynamic FBA formalism was also used to study the sensitivity to the objective function. It was found that an instantaneous objective function resulted in better predictions than a terminal-type objective function. The constraints that govern the growth at different phases in the batch culture were also identified. Therefore, dynamic FBA provides a framework for analyzing the transience of metabolism due to metabolic reprogramming and for obtaining insights for the design of metabolic networks.},

	abstract = {Most microbial communities change with time in response to changes and/or perturbations in environmental conditions. Temporal variations in interspecies metabolic interactions within these communities can signiﬁcantly aﬀect their structure and function. Here, we introduce d-OptCom, an extension of the OptCom procedure, for the dynamic metabolic modeling of microbial communities. It enables capturing the temporal dynamics of biomass concentration of the community members and extracellular concentration of the shared metabolites, while integrating species- and communitylevel ﬁtness functions. The applicability of d-OptCom was demonstrated by modeling the dynamic co-growth of auxotrophic mutant pairs of E. coli and by computationally assessing the dynamics and composition of a uranium-reducing community comprised of Geobacter sulf urreducens, Rhodoferax ferrireducens, and Shewanella oneidensis. d-OptCom was also employed to examine the impact of lactate vs acetate addition on the relative abundance of uranium-reducing species. These studies highlight the importance of simultaneously accounting for both species- and community-level ﬁtness functions when modeling microbial communities, and demonstrate that the incorporation of uptake kinetic information can substantially improve the prediction of interspecies ﬂux traﬃcking. Overall, this study paves the way for the dynamic multi-level and multi-objective analysis of microbial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Genome-scale constraint-based models of several organisms have now been constructed and are being used for model driven research. A key issue that may arise in the use of such models is the existence of alternate optimal solutions wherein the same maximal objective (e.g., growth rate) can be achieved through different ﬂux distributions. Herein, we investigate the effects that alternate optimal solutions may have on the predicted range of ﬂux values calculated using currently practiced linear (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) methods. An efﬁcient LP-based strategy is described to calculate the range of ﬂux variability that can be present in order to achieve optimal as well as suboptimal objective states. Sample results are provided for growth predictions of E. coli using glucose, acetate, and lactate as carbon substrates. These results demonstrate the extent of ﬂux variability to be highly dependent on environmental conditions and network composition. In addition we examined the impact of alternate optima for growth under gene knockout conditions as calculated using QP-based methods. It was observed that calculations using QP-based methods can show signiﬁcant variation in growth rate if the ﬂux variability among alternate optima is high. The underlying biological signiﬁcance and general source of such ﬂux variability is further investigated through the identiﬁcation of redundancies in the network (equivalent reaction sets) that lead to alternate solutions. Collectively, these results illustrate the variability inherent in metabolic ﬂux distributions and the possible implications of this heterogeneity for constraint-based modeling approaches. These methods also provide an efﬁcient and robust method to calculate the range of ﬂux distributions that can be derived from quantitative fermentation data.},

	abstract = {Microbes have an astonishing capacity to transform their environments. Yet, the metabolic capacity of a single species is limited and the vast majority of microorganisms form complex communities and join forces to exhibit capabilities far exceeding those achieved by any single species. Such enhanced metabolic capacities represent a promising route to many medical, environmental, and industrial applications and call for the development of a predictive, systems-level understanding of synergistic microbial capacity. Here we present a comprehensive computational framework, integrating high-quality metabolic models of multiple species, temporal dynamics, and flux variability analysis, to study the metabolic capacity and dynamics of simple two-species microbial ecosystems. We specifically focus on detecting emergent biosynthetic capacity – instances in which a community growing on some medium produces and secretes metabolites that are not secreted by any member species when growing in isolation on that same medium. Using this framework to model a large collection of two-species communities on multiple media, we demonstrate that emergent biosynthetic capacity is highly prevalent. We identify commonly observed emergent metabolites and metabolic reprogramming patterns, characterizing typical mechanisms of emergent capacity. We further find that emergent secretion tends to occur in two waves, the first as soon as the two organisms are introduced, and the second when the medium is depleted and nutrients become limited. Finally, aiming to identify global community determinants of emergent capacity, we find a marked association between the level of emergent biosynthetic capacity and the functional/phylogenetic distance between community members. Specifically, we demonstrate a ‘‘Goldilocks’’ principle, where high levels of emergent capacity are observed when the species comprising the community are functionally neither too close, nor too distant. Taken together, our results demonstrate the potential to design and engineer synthetic communities capable of novel metabolic activities and point to promising future directions in environmental and clinical bioengineering.},

Fermentative microorganisms can reduce compounds such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), but detoxiﬁcation is accompanied by reduced growth rates and ethanol yields. In this study, we assess the effects of these furan aldehydes on pure and mixed yeast cultures consisting of a respiratory deﬁcient mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and wild-type Scheffersomyces stipitis using dynamic ﬂux balance analysis. Uptake kinetics and stoichiometric equations for the intracellular reduction reactions associated with each inhibitor were added to genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of the two yeasts. Further modiﬁcation of the S. cerevisiae metabolic network was necessary to satisfactorily predict the amount of acetate synthesized during HMF reduction. Inhibitory terms that captured the adverse effects of the furan aldehydes and their corresponding alcohols on cell growth and ethanol production were added to attain qualitative agreement with batch experiments conducted for model development and validation. When the two yeasts were co-cultured in the presence of the furan aldehydes, inoculums that reduced the synthesis of highly toxic acetate produced by S. cerevisiae yielded the highest ethanol productivities. The model described here can be used to generate optimal fermentation strategies for the simultaneous detoxiﬁcation and fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates by S. cerevisiae and/or S. stipitis.},

	abstract = {Background: A key step in any process that converts lignocellulose to biofuels is the efficient fermentation of both hexose and pentose sugars. The co-culture of respiratory-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae and wild-type Scheffersomyces stipitis has been identified as a promising system for microaerobic ethanol production because S. cerevisiae only consumes glucose while S. stipitis efficiently converts xylose to ethanol.
Results: To better predict how these two yeasts behave in batch co-culture and to optimize system performance, a dynamic flux balance model describing co-culture metabolism was developed from genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of the individual organisms. First a dynamic model was developed for each organism by estimating substrate uptake kinetic parameters from batch pure culture data and evaluating model extensibility to different microaerobic growth conditions. The co-culture model was constructed by combining the two individual models assuming a cellular objective of total growth rate maximization. To obtain accurate predictions of batch co-culture data collected at different microaerobic conditions, the S. cerevisiae maximum glucose uptake rate was reduced from its pure culture value to account for more efficient S. stipitis glucose uptake in co-culture. The dynamic coculture model was used to predict the inoculum concentration and aeration level that maximized batch ethanol productivity. The model predictions were validated with batch co-culture experiments performed at the optimal conditions. Furthermore, the dynamic model was used to predict how engineered improvements to the S. stipitis xylose transport system could improve co-culture ethanol production.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate the utility of the dynamic co-culture metabolic model for guiding process and metabolic engineering efforts aimed at increasing microaerobic ethanol production from glucose/xylose mixtures.},

	abstract = {Background: The gut microbiota plays an important role in human health and disease by acting as a metabolic organ. Metagenomic sequencing has shown how dysbiosis in the gut microbiota is associated with human metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Modeling may assist to gain insight into the metabolic implication of an altered microbiota. Fast and accurate reconstruction of metabolic models for members of the gut microbiota, as well as methods to simulate a community of microorganisms, are therefore needed. The Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database contains functional annotation for nearly 4,650 bacterial genomes. This tremendous new genomic information adds new opportunities for systems biology to reconstruct accurate genome scale metabolic models (GEMs).
Results: Here we assembled a reaction data set containing 2,340 reactions obtained from existing genome-scale metabolic models, where each reaction is assigned with KEGG Orthology. The reaction data set was then used to reconstruct two genome scale metabolic models for gut microorganisms available in the IMG database Bifidobacterium adolescentis L2-32, which produces acetate during fermentation, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165, which consumes acetate and produces butyrate. F. prausnitzii is less abundant in patients with Crohn’s disease and has been suggested to play an anti-inflammatory role in the gut ecosystem. The B. adolescentis model, iBif452, comprises 699 reactions and 611 unique metabolites. The F. prausnitzii model, iFap484, comprises 713 reactions and 621 unique metabolites. Each model was validated with in vivo data. We used OptCom and Flux Balance Analysis to simulate how both organisms interact.
Conclusions: The consortium of iBif452 and iFap484 was applied to predict F. prausnitzii’s demand for acetate and production of butyrate which plays an essential role in colonic homeostasis and cancer prevention. The assembled reaction set is a useful tool to generate bacterial draft models from KEGG Orthology.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms rarely live isolated in their natural environments but rather function in consolidated and socializing communities. Despite the growing availability of high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic data, we still know very little about the metabolic contributions of individual microbial players within an ecological niche and the extent and directionality of interactions among them. This calls for development of efficient modeling frameworks to shed light on less understood aspects of metabolism in microbial communities. Here, we introduce OptCom, a comprehensive flux balance analysis framework for microbial communities, which relies on a multi-level and multi-objective optimization formulation to properly describe trade-offs between individual vs. community level fitness criteria. In contrast to earlier approaches that rely on a single objective function, here, we consider species-level fitness criteria for the inner problems while relying on community-level objective maximization for the outer problem. OptCom is general enough to capture any type of interactions (positive, negative or combinations thereof) and is capable of accommodating any number of microbial species (or guilds) involved. We applied OptCom to quantify the syntrophic association in a well-characterized two-species microbial system, assess the level of sub-optimal growth in phototrophic microbial mats, and elucidate the extent and direction of inter-species metabolite and electron transfer in a model microbial community. We also used OptCom to examine addition of a new member to an existing community. Our study demonstrates the importance of trade-offs between species- and community-level fitness driving forces and lays the foundation for metabolic-driven analysis of various types of interactions in multi-species microbial systems using genome-scale metabolic models.},

	abstract = {Dynamic ﬂux balance analysis (DFBA) provides a platform for detailed design, control and optimization of biochemical process technologies. It is a promising modeling framework that combines genome-scale metabolic network analysis with dynamic simulation of the extracellular environment. Dynamic ﬂux balance analysis assumes that the intracellular species concentrations are in equilibrium with the extracellular environment. The resulting underdetermined stoichiometric model is solved under the assumption of a biochemical objective such as growth rate maximization. The model of the metabolism is coupled with the dynamic mass balance equations of the extracellular environment via expressions for the rates of substrate uptake and product excretion, which imposes additional constraints on the linear program (LP) deﬁned by growth rate maximization of the metabolism. The linear program is embedded into the dynamic model of the bioreactor, and together with the additional constraints this provides an accurate model of the substrate consumption, product secretion, and biomass production during operation. A DFBA model consists of a system of ordinary differential equations for which the evaluation of the right-hand side requires not only function evaluations, but also the solution of one or more linear programs. The numerical tool presented here accurately and efﬁciently simulates large-scale dynamic ﬂux balance models. The main advantages that this approach has over existing implementation are that the integration scheme has a variable step size, that the linear program only has to be solved when qualitative changes in the optimal ﬂux distribution of the metabolic network occur, and that it can reliably simulate behavior near the boundary of the domain where the model is deﬁned. This is illustrated through large-scale examples taken from the literature.},

	abstract = {Background: Metabolic interactions involve the exchange of metabolic products among microbial species. Most microbes live in communities and usually rely on metabolic interactions to increase their supply for nutrients and better exploit a given environment. Constraint-based models have successfully analyzed cellular metabolism and described genotype-phenotype relations. However, there are only a few studies of genome-scale multi-species interactions. Based on genome-scale approaches, we present a graph-theoretic approach together with a metabolic model in order to explore the metabolic variability among bacterial strains and identify and describe metabolically interacting strain communities in a batch culture consisting of two or more strains. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to the bacterium E. coli across different single-carbon-source conditions.
Results: A different diversity graph is constructed for each growth condition. The graph-theoretic properties of the constructed graphs reflect the inherent high metabolic redundancy of the cell to single-gene knockouts, reveal mutant-hubs of unique metabolic capabilities regarding by-production, demonstrate consistent metabolic behaviors across conditions and show an evolutionary difficulty towards the establishment of polymorphism, while suggesting that communities consisting of strains specifically adapted to a given condition are more likely to evolve. We reveal several strain communities of improved growth relative to corresponding monocultures, even though strain communities are not modeled to operate towards a collective goal, such as the community growth and we identify the range of metabolites that are exchanged in these batch co-cultures.
Conclusions: This study provides a genome-scale description of the metabolic variability regarding by-production among E. coli strains under different conditions and shows how metabolic differences can be used to identify metabolically interacting strain communities. This work also extends the existing stoichiometric models in order to describe batch co-cultures and provides the extent of metabolic interactions in a strain community revealing their importance for growth.},

Evolutionary game theory replaces the static solutions of classical game theory by a dynamical approach centered not on the concept of rational players but on the population dynamics of behavioral programs. In this book the authors investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the self-regulation of social and economic behavior, and of the closely related interactions among species in ecological communities. Replicator equations describe how successful strategies spread and thereby create new conditions that can alter the basis of their success, i.e., to enable us to understand the strategic and genetic foundations of the endless chronicle of invasions and extinctions that punctuate evolution. In short, evolutionary game theory describes when to escalate a conflict, how to elicit cooperation, why to expect a balance of the sexes, and how to understand natural selection in mathematical terms.},

The LP is said to be embedded since the dynamics depend on the solution of the LP, which is in turn parameterized by the dynamic states. This problem formulation ﬁnds application in dynamic ﬂux balance analysis, which serves as a modeling framework for industrial fermentation reactions. It is shown that the problem formulation can be intractable numerically, which arises from the fact that the LP induces an effective domain that may not be open. A numerical method is developed which reformulates the system so that it is deﬁned on an open set. The result is a system of semi-explicit indexone differential algebraic equations, which can be solved with efﬁcient and accurate methods. It is shown that this method addresses many of the issues stemming from the original problem’s intractability. The application of the method to examples of industrial fermentation processes demonstrates its effectiveness and efﬁciency.},

In this study, however, we provide the first tool to evaluate the dynamic interaction that exists between them. A stoichiometric model, using wine fermentation as a case study, was constructed to simulate batch cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Five differential equations describe the evolution of the main metabolites and biomass in the fermentation tank, while a set of underdetermined linear algebraic equations models the pseudosteady-state microbial metabolism. Specific links between process variables and the reaction rates of metabolic pathways represent microorganism adaptation to environmental changes in the culture. Adaptation requirements to changes in the environment, optimal growth, and homeostasis were set as the physiological objectives. A linear programming routine was used to define optimal metabolic mass flux distribution at each instant throughout the process. The kinetics of the process arise from the dynamic interaction between the environment and metabolic flux distribution. The model assessed the effect of nitrogen starvation and ethanol toxicity in wine fermentation and it was able to simulate fermentation profiles qualitatively, while experimental fermentation yields were reproduced successfully as well. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Three metabolic network models ranging from a single compartment representation of metabolism to a genome-scale reconstruction with seven compartments and detailed charge balancing were studied. Steady-state analysis showed that the models generated similar wild-type predictions for the biomass and ethanol yields, but for ten engineered strains the seven compartment model produced smaller ethanol yield enhancements. Simplification of the seven compartment model to two intracellular compartments produced increased ethanol yields, suggesting that reaction localisation had an impact on mutant phenotype predictions. Further analysis with the seven compartment model demonstrated that steady-state predictions can be sensitive to intracellular model parameters, with the biomass yield exhibiting high sensitivity to ATP utilisation parameters and the biomass composition. The incorporation of gene expression data through the zeroing of metabolic reactions associated with unexpressed genes was shown to produce negligible changes in steady-state predictions when the oxygen uptake rate was suitably constrained. Dynamic extensions of the single and seven compartment models were developed through the addition of glucose and oxygen uptake expressions and transient extracellular balances. While the dynamic models produced similar predictions of the optimal batch ethanol productivity for the wild type, the single compartment model produced significantly different predictions for four implementable gene insertions. A combined deletion/overexpression/insertion mutant with improved ethanol productivity capabilities was computationally identified by dynamically screening multiple combinations of the ten metabolic engineering strategies. The authors concl- uded that extensive compartmentalisation and detailed charge balancing can be important for reliably screening metabolic engineering strategies that rely on modification of the global redox balance and that DFBA offers the potential to identify novel mutants for enhanced metabolite production in batch and fed-batch cultures.},

Being able to predict such fermentations would enable enologists to take preventive actions. In this study we modeled sugar uptake kinetics and coupled them to a previously developed stoichiometric model, which describes the anaerobic metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The resulting model was used to predict normal and slow fermentations under winemaking conditions. The effects of fermentation temperature and initial nitrogen concentration were modeled through an efﬁciency factor incorporated into the sugar uptake expressions. The model required few initial parameters to successfully reproduce glucose, fructose, and ethanol proﬁles of laboratory and industrial fermentations. Glycerol and biomass proﬁles were successfully predicted in nitrogen rich cultures. The time normal or slow wine fermentations needed to complete the process was predicted accurately, at different temperatures. Simulations with a model representing a genetically modiﬁed yeast fermentation, reproduced qualitatively well literature results regarding the formation of minor compounds involved in wine complexity and aroma. Therefore, the model also proves useful to explore the effects of genetic modiﬁcations on fermentation proﬁles.},

Metabolic engineering strategies previously identiﬁed for their enhanced steady-state biomass and/or ethanol yields are evaluated for fed-batch performance in glucose and glucose/xylose media. Dynamic analysis is shown to provide a single quantitative measure of fed-batch ethanol productivity that explicitly handles the possible tradeoff between the biomass and ethanol yields. Productivity optimization conducted to rank achievable fed-batch performance demonstrates that the genetic manipulation strategy and the fed-batch operating policy should be considered simultaneously. A library of candidate gene insertions is assembled and directly screened for their achievable ethanol productivity in fed-batch culture. A number of novel gene insertions with ethanol productivities identical to the best metabolic engineering strategies reported in previous studies are identiﬁed, thereby providing additional targets for experimental evaluation. The top performing gene insertions were substrate dependent, with the highest ranked insertions for glucose media yielding suboptimal performance in glucose/xylose media. The analysis results suggest that enhancements in biomass yield are most beneﬁcial for the enhancement of fed-batch ethanol productivity by recombinant xylose utilizing yeast strains. We conclude that steady-state ﬂux balance analysis is not sufﬁcient to predict fed-batch performance and that the media, genetic manipulations, and fed-batch operating policy should be considered simultaneously to achieve optimal metabolite productivity.},

	abstract = {Extracellular cues affect signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes to elicit cellular responses. Although intracellular signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks are highly integrated, previous analyses have largely focused on independent processes (e.g., metabolism) without considering the interplay that exists among them. However, there is evidence that many diseases arise from multifunctional components with roles throughout signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks. Therefore, in this study, we propose a flux balance analysis (FBA)–based strategy, referred to as integrated dynamic FBA (idFBA), that dynamically simulates cellular phenotypes arising from integrated networks. The idFBA framework requires an integrated stoichiometric reconstruction of signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes. It assumes quasi-steady-state conditions for ‘‘fast’’ reactions and incorporates ‘‘slow’’ reactions into the stoichiometric formalism in a time-delayed manner. To assess the efficacy of idFBA, we developed a prototypic integrated system comprising signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes with network features characteristic of actual systems and incorporating kinetic parameters based on typical time scales observed in literature. idFBA was applied to the prototypic system, which was evaluated for different environments and gene regulatory rules. In addition, we applied the idFBA framework in a similar manner to a representative module of the single-cell eukaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ultimately, idFBA facilitated quantitative, dynamic analysis of systemic effects of extracellular cues on cellular phenotypes and generated comparable time-course predictions when contrasted with an equivalent kinetic model. Since idFBA solves a linear programming problem and does not require an exhaustive list of detailed kinetic parameters, it may be efficiently scaled to integrated intracellular systems that incorporate signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes at the genome scale, such as the S. cerevisiae system presented here.},

Optimization of the fermentation is a challenging task that greatly benefits from dynamic models able to accurately describe and predict the fermentation profile and resulting products under different genetic and environmental conditions. In this article, we developed and validated a genome-scale dynamic flux balance model, using experimentally determined kinetic constraints.
Results: Appropriate equations for maintenance, biomass composition, anaerobic metabolism and nutrient uptake are key to improve model performance, especially for predicting glycerol and ethanol synthesis. Prediction profiles of synthesis and consumption of the main metabolites involved in alcoholic fermentation closely agreed with experimental data obtained from numerous lab and industrial fermentations under different environmental conditions. Finally, fermentation simulations of genetically engineered yeasts closely reproduced previously reported experimental results regarding final concentrations of the main fermentation products such as ethanol and glycerol.
Conclusion: A useful tool to describe, understand and predict metabolite production in batch yeast cultures was developed. The resulting model, if used wisely, could help to search for new metabolic engineering strategies to manage ethanol content in batch fermentations.},

However, process optimization is hampered by lack of quantitative models of mammalian cellular metabolism in these cultures. This paper presents a new kinetic model of CHO cell metabolism and a novel framework for simulating the dynamics of metabolic and biosynthetic pathways of these cells grown in fed-batch culture. The model deﬁnes a subset of the intracellular reactions with kinetic rate expressions based on extracellular metabolite concentrations and temperature- and redox-dependent regulatory variables. The simulation uses the rate expressions to calculate pseudo-steady state ﬂux distributions and extracellular metabolite concentrations at discrete time points. Experimental data collected in this study for several different CHO cell fed-batch cultures are used to derive the rate expressions, ﬁt the parameters, and validate the model. The simulations accurately predicted the effects of process variables, including temperature shift, seed density, speciﬁc productivity, and nutrient concentrations. \& 2010 Elsevier Inc.
