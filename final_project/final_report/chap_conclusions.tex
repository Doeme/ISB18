\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
	The DFBA framework performs properly, and simulates the Lactobacillus Plantarum and Saccharomyces Cerevisiae monocultures and cocultures
	approximately as experimental results.
	\subsection{Further Work}
		Further efforts can be made by replacing scipy.integrate.ode with a
		different solver framework (for example odespy \cite{odespy}), to make implicite solvers with adaptive step-sizes available.
		Since the problem seems to be somewhat stiff (e.g. the fast changing oxygen depletion combined with the slower glucose usage),
		the switch will most likely result in a speedup in simulation time.
		
		Furthermore, the system does not allow metabolite exchanges from the medium to the surrounding environment via concentration gradients.
		Allowing those would open up the simulator to a wider range of applications, e.g. for simulating continuous production of a metabolite with
		continuous feeding.
		
		Lastly, a method to recycle dead cells could be added, countering the loss of metabolites in the medium.
